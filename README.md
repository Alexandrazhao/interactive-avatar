# Sketch 6: Interactive Avatar

**Create an interactive version of your p5.js game avatar.**

## Rules

1. Fork the sketch on github.
2. Write a comment that includes your name, email, date, collaboration
statement, and reflection.
3. Create a static image using color and shape primitives (e.g. point,
line, rect, quad, triangle).
4. Incorporate some static animation component.
5. Add a dynamic aspect (e.g. using random).

6. Make the sketch interactive using the mouse, keyboard,
conditionals, and event handlers.

## Learning Objectives
- More practice with coordinates, colors, shapes.
- Use event handlers.
- Use conditional statements.
- Create a dynamic picture with code.
- Simulate yourself.

When you are finished, reflect in a comment at the top of your sketch
about how this avatar is different from your previous sketch. Explain
how your project explores Victorâ€™s four different types of dynamic
pictures. Also reflect on drawing with code, in terms of the dynamic
program, the static program (i.e., source code), and the process.
